# Polyomino
This a research project designed to test my knowledge of GUIs and mathematics. As the description states, given some game of checkers, the program must find all the polyominoes enclosed. It must change on every turn, so it must be efficient enough not to slow down the game or cause significant lag between the polyomino view and the game view.
