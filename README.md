# Polyominoes
This a final research project designed to test my knowledge of discrete mathematics, specifically challenging my knowledge of Graph Theory, and Set Theory. As the description states, given some game of checkers, the program must find all the polyominoes enclosed. A polyomino is a plane geometric figure formed by joining one or more equal squares edge to edge. It is a polyform whose cells are squares. It may be regarded as a finite subset of the regular square tiling.

It must change on every turn, so it must be efficient enough not to slow down the game or cause significant lag between the polyomino view and the game view.

Most challengingly, it must also be accurate.
